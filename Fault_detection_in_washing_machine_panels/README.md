# Fault Detection in Washing Machine Panel

Detection of product quality using historical vibration data, quality data and production log-data.

Idea is to help Kruse GmbH develop a quality monitoring system, that identifies the quality of the printing 
on the washing machine panel and identify faults in its manufacturing based on the historical vibration data, quality and production log-data.
